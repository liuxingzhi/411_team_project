                    <p><strong>TO CV OR NOT TO CV?</strong>That is the question … well, at least it is for some. If you
                        are pursuing a career in academia, science or possibly a role abroad, knowing the what, when,
                        why and how of a Curriculum Vitae can be essential. Here are some tips to compose an effective
                        CV.</p>
                    <p><strong>What is a CV?</strong> A CV is an overview of a person's experience and academic
                        background for the use in a job application. The CV captures your professional and educational
                        credentials and history in a chronological order. It is reviewed by a hiring authority as an
                        initial step in the hiring process to determine if someone's background merits an interview.</p>

                    <p><strong>Why use a CV and how does it compare to a resume?</strong> Andrei Kurtuy, a resume and CV
                        writing expert, identified a key difference in a blog he authored in February as "static versus
                        dynamic content." A resume should be customized to each role and displays qualifications that
                        are of interest based on a specific role. It should be similar to a marketing document that
                        communicates value related to a specific audience. A CV, on the other hand, is static. It is a
                        historical document that consistently reflects the same background regardless of the role.</p>

                    <p>Here are some additional ways the two documents differ: Work experience in a CV is typically
                        listed in chronological order while resumes are usually in reverse chronological order. The goal
                        of a CV is to show a comprehensive, detailed progression; a resume emphasizes relevant
                        experience done most recently. CVs do not face the same pressure to be one to two pages. They
                        are comprehensive documents that use as much room as is needed to properly cover your
                        background. Finally, resumes err a bit more on the stylized side these days with color and other
                        formatting tactics to add visual interest. CVs, on the other hand, do not require the same
                        emphasis on creative styling or formatting. They should be easy to read, well-organized and
                        well-written.</p>

                    <p><strong>When do I use a CV and when do I use a resume?</strong> A CV is the brand standard for
                        many international roles. If you are looking to apply for a position abroad, chances are the
                        request will be for a CV. Domestically, careers in academia or higher education and sciences
                        often ask for a CV. Frequently, a job application will request one or the other. If you are
                        uncertain, it is always OK to ask what is preferred.</p>

                    </a>

                    <p><strong>How do I create a CV?</strong> Gather details of your education, academic achievements,
                        research, publications, awards, affiliations and employment history. You begin the document with
                        contact information and follow with academic credentials – starting with highest level degree
                        earned first. Next, list your research and work experience in chronological order (unless
                        directed to list differently). Other qualifications to include are skills, training, research,
                        dissertations, teaching experience, publications, presentations/speaking engagements, grants,
                        fellowships, awards and honors. You should also add any professional licenses, certifications or
                        memberships.</p>

                    <p>Remember that a CV is professional correspondence, so it merits meticulous editing and review. Be
                        sure to use proper grammar, punctuation, formatting and pay close attention to consistency in
                        layout and style. The use of bullet points versus complete sentences and paragraphs can be very
                        effective in managing attention and minimizing extra content. You can also create an addendum to
                        support very long lists of publications, speaking engagements or awards if needed.</p>

                    <p>It is also important to avoid including any prohibited information based on the hiring laws in
                        the geography where you are applying. For example, omit age, ethnicity, marital or family status
                        and salary information for any roles in the United States. Also, reserve names and contact
                        information of references for when it is requested. There is no need to include references on
                        your CV.</p>

                    <p>In summary, a well-written CV gives a comprehensive overview of how your background and
                        qualifications make you an ideal candidate for a role. To write a good one, first gather and
                        organize all relevant materials. Next, create a well-written, well-edited document with an
                        easy-to-read format. And finally, submit your CV on a timely basis and possibly through a
                        referral to get the process started for your next role in higher education, scientific research
                        or abroad.</p>
