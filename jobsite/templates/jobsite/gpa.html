                    <p><strong>RECENTLY GRADUATED FROM Harvard with a 4.0 GPA</strong>, have a great personality and
                        well-connected parents? Good news: You just bought yourself at least 10 extra minutes because
                        you don't need to read the rest of this blog post. For the rest of the current college students
                        and recent graduates who do not meet that standard, here are some things you need to know about
                        how employers view your GPA.</p>
                    <p>GPA matters (sometimes). Most professionals who did well in college tend to regard a strong GPA
                        as an indicator that a potential employee can handle pressure, learns quickly and is motivated
                        to succeed. The theory is that college has been the greatest challenge faced by those younger
                        than 22, so success there is the only significant experience that has a correlation to success
                        in the professional world. Additionally, earning a college degree is an exercise in delayed
                        gratification. A student must exert effort for four to six years before receiving a degree.
                        Students with higher GPAs have demonstrated that they can maintain a high level of focus and
                        results over that time before they receive their payoff. This journey mirrors the one most
                        employers hope new hires will experience. Employees who have evidence of prolonged focus, effort
                        and patience while achieving a long-term goal are often good bets when hiring.</p>

                    <p>While the merits of this line of thinking may be debatable, it is more likely that the company or
                        manager who values a high GPA will stick to that philosophy.</p>

                    <p>Some highly competitive roles or very desirable employers use GPA standards as a way to cut down
                        the list of potential employees to consider. Since the percentage of graduates who complete
                        school with a 3.5 (for example) or higher is quite small, requiring a 3.5 or higher is an
                        effective way to tighten the applicant pool immediately. While there are a few employers or
                        select employment programs that target GPAs of 3.5, most companies that have a GPA requirement
                        target 3.0 or 3.3 and higher. These requirements still limit the applicant pool, but clearly are
                        more inclusive.</p>

                    <p>The good news is that for most managers or companies, GPA is not a deal-killer. The majority of
                        hiring authorities are satisfied with your achievement of a college degree. Many successful
                        entrepreneurs didn't complete college and did not enjoy or excel at learning in a classroom
                        environment. Other executives may value the "school of life" more highly than an academically
                        rigorous college experience. If you are interviewing with one of these types of managers, your
                        focus should be on communicating how you have solved problems, been responsible, worked hard and
                        succeeded in the face of life's challenges.</p>

                    </a>

                    <p>If you are targeting a job where your GPA is a selection criterion, how do you address a
                        less-than-desirable one? First, look at your transcript to see the story it tells. While numbers
                        are not the whole picture, employers who ask about your GPA may also require a copy of your
                        transcript. It is best to approach any issues head-on. For example, many students really enjoy
                        their first year of college. If you were one of these students who didn't get a clue until
                        mid-sophomore year that you are actually supposed to go inside the classroom if you want better
                        grades, your transcript likely shows an improvement in performance year over year. If this is
                        the case, you can calculate your GPA after you made the "change" and be prepared to share in an
                        interview that while you take ownership of your GPA, the results from your last six semesters
                        are better evidence of your academic potential.</p>

                    <p>A second issue frequently faced is a lack of interest in required courses versus selected courses
                        or the ones in your chosen field of study. Most people realize that when you are not interested
                        in the subject matter, you often perform worse in recall and testing. If your transcript shows
                        that your general education classes have a C average, but you received all A's and B's in your
                        major, be sure to communicate that.</p>

                    <p>Also, if you experienced a significant life event or have a learning disability that may have
                        affected your performance in class, that may be helpful to share as well. Enduring those
                        challenges demonstrates that you have the tenacity, drive and persistence to make it to the
                        finish line in school and in life, even when the obstacles are high. Of course, if you just did
                        not do well in school, you will need to be prepared to discuss why results at work will be
                        different. It is helpful to include other activities, involvement or interests you may have had
                        concurrent to taking classes.</p>

                    <p>Once you graduate, you cannot go back and change your GPA. However, your ability to put the
                        numbers in context will go a long way with those employers who value GPA but do not use it as a
                        deal-breaker when hiring. And be sure to come to your interviews prepared. Thoroughly research
                        the employer and know how you can make a significant impact in the role. Those job seekers who
                        understand and can clearly communicate their value in the workplace do better in the selection
                        process. You are not being hired for your past, so make sure to show that your future is
                        promising.</p>
